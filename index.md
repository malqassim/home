## Hello, My name is Mona Alqassim and I'm really excited about socio-technical systems and human centered design!

I have a PhD in [Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) from T[he University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where my thesis work investigated socio-teachinical approach to support miscarriage. I provided an in-depth understanding of the needs and experiences of women who have experinced miscarriage, with a particular focus on who are the people in their care netowrk, how they interact with their care network, and how they leverage tecahnology to gain their social support needs. Conducting research with this population of women with miscarriage experince necessitated creative approaches to research.
